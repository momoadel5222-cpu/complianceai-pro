Previously associated with the Islamic State in Iraq\n                and the Levant (ISIL), listed as Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115), and its leader Ibrahim\n                Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai (QDi.299) but separated from that group in\n                2013. In Jul. 2016, Abu Mohammed Al-Jawlani (QDi.317), the leader of Al-Nusrah Front\n                for the People of the Levant, announced the group had changed its name to Jabhat\n                Fath al-Sham and was no longer affiliated with any external entity. Despite the\n                announcement and attempts to distinguish itself from Al-Nusrah Front for the People\n                of the Levant, the group remains aligned with Al-Qaida and continues to carry out\n                terrorist operations under this new name. In January 2017, Al-Nusrah Front created\n                Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) as a vehicle to advance its position in the Syrian\n                insurgency and further its own goals as Al-Qaida’s affiliate in Syria. Previously\n                listed between 30 May 2013 and 13 May 2014 as an aka of Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115).\n                Review pursuant to Security Council resolution 2368 (2017) was concluded on 15 November 2021.            \n             INTERPOL-UN Security Council Special Notice web link:https://www.interpol.int/en/How-we-work/Notices/View-UN-Notices-Individuals"
